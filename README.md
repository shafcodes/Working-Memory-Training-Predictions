# Working-Memory-Training-Predictions
A first attempt at predicting learning behavior on a short-burst working memory training that spanned approximately 2 weeks.

This analysis is associated with an unpublished project, hence all code is only for private use for now. 
In a few months, we will open source the code for anyone to use. Please send me an email if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss this in detail.
